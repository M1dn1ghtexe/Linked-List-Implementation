A linked list is a data structure used to store a collection of elements, called nodes, where each node contains two main components: a data field that holds the value and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion of elements. The first node is referred to as the head, and the last node points to null (or a sentinel value) to signify the end of the list. Linked lists come in various forms, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists, each with its own characteristics and advantages.
I created this custom Linked List class with many  interesting  and useful methods , mostly from competitive programming problems that I solve.
